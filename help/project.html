<p>At the top of the page is the Quarterly Accomplishments that you selected (if you selected any of course).</p>

<p>Following that are the rest of the projects for the time period you selected. Here is where the <b>type</b> of 
task you selected (if you used it). Then meetings are its own section and you can pretty much ignore them for 
the determining of what you want to put into the quarterly or yearly accomplishments.</p>

<p>The layout is simple if a little bulky.</p>

<p>Each entry consists of three lines. The top line are drop downs. Select the one the entry should be in. The 
last entry box is the number of 15 minute increments the task tool.</p>

<p>The second line is the task itself. Make any changes to it here.</p>

<p>The third line has the type, the checkboxes, and whether to save or delete the line.</p>

<p>Clicking the save button will update the database with any changes. The three lines will turn green when 
the database has been updated.</p>

<p>If you want to delete a line, in case you tried to enter a line more than once, you will be prompted to 
make sure and then the three lines will turn red once the entry has been removed.</p>

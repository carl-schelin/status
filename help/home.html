<p>The Status Management Menu is the main access to let you manage your status's. From here you can add new, edit, 
delete, e-mail, view timecard, copy, and view all of your reports. There are additional administrative functions, 
not all of which will be available to you.</p>

<p>This page is generated using your login information.</p>

<p>The script retrieves the last time you entered something into the database and automatically populates the week 
with that information. A new user will see "None" for the week and of course, after the first time you enter data, 
the date will change.</p>

<p>The script also retrieves group and group membership information. As you can see in the example, there are 
drop downs that you probably won't see. Supervisors will be able to see their team status reports, either 
individually or as a group listing (select the team member from the drop down list or select the group from 
the other one).</p>

<h4>Enter Weekly Data</h4>

<p>This is the selection when you want to manage your status report. If the week is not correct, select the 
correct one before clicking the button.</p>

<h4>Edit Weekly Data</h4>

<p>This selection brings you into an edit screen for the week you selected. Because of the way the data is displayed 
on the Enter Weekly Data page, you may find you can't enter any more data, generally with a tick mark (') or if 
you enter a hash (#). If that happens, go into this page, find the line and make the correction.</p>

<h4>Review Weekly Data</h4>

<p>Use this selection to review your weekly report. It's presented as the e-mail you will receive looks. You can 
go back and edit the data from within this page as well.</p>

<h4>View Timecard</h4>

<p>If you decide to enter your time and day in addition to entering your status's, this selection will show you 
a representation of the iConnect timecard data entry form to make it easier to enter your timecard in iConnect 
(it takes me about 7 minutes to complete my timecard now). You also see a graph of the week with Jeff's graph 
to the right of it for comparison.</p>

<p>There are two week options you can select, a start week and an end week. This would let you review several 
weeks of timecards, for instance if you wanted to look at a quarter (January through March), you would select 
the start week (note that the end week is automatically changed to the start week) and then select the end week. 
Clicking the button will provide you with the totals for the time period selected.</p>

<h4>Copy Week</h4>

<p>If you do fairly similar work from week to week, select a source week to get the common status report entries 
from and then a target week (generally next week) to copy the data to. The data is a straight copy and none of 
the data that currently exists in the target week will be replaced or deleted.</p>

<h4>View Project Reports</h4>

<p>This selection provides a listing of all of your status reports for the time period selected broken out 
first by Quarterly Accomplishments (if any are selected) and then a second section by projects. The project 
data is further broken out by status type to aid in managing the status'.</p>

<h4>Administrative Tasks</h4>

<p>This section is a list of links to other tasks that can be done that aren't directly related to managing 
your status reports. There is a brief description next to each link where the link isn't obvious. The top 
two links you see on the list are only available to the administrator of the application (that's me).</p>

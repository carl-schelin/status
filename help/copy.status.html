<title>Copy Week</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>This is a fairly simple selection.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the week you want to copy.</li>
  <li>Select the week you want to copy the data to.</li>
  <li>Click the "Copy Week" link.</li>
</ul>

<p>The script simply takes every entry with your name for the week selected and copies it to new entries in the 
database with just the week changed to the target week. So no lost data.</p>

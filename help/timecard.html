<p>If you're managing your time, it will be displayed here.</p>

<center><img src="timecard.jpg"></center>

<p>There is a bit more you can do here.</p>

<p>The title bar has a pair of less than and greater than characters along with a single set. Clicking on the double 
less than character link (&lt;&lt;) will subtract one from the starting week giving you one additional week view. 
Clicking on the double greater than character link (&gt;&gt;) will add one to the ending week again providing an 
additional weeks data to view. This might be interesting if you want to see how many hours you worked over a period 
of time.</p>

<p>Clicking on the single less than or greater than character links (&lt;&gt;) will move both the start and end 
week values by one week.</p>

<p>The table below that is the same layout as the iConnect time card. My method is to bring up my iConnect time 
card and zero out all the entries. Then use this and quickly enter in the values from the Status Management 
timecard. It speeds things up significantly.</p>

<p>There are two graphs below the table. The one on the right is Jeff's expectation for the entire group's breakdown 
in time. The one on the left is your time graphed out per Jeff's instructions. Your graph may be a little or even a 
lot different than Jeff's but Jeff's is meant to be for the entire group vs an individual.</p>

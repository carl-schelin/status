<title>Review and Email Weekly Status Report</title>

<body>

<p>Use this page to review the status report before mailing it to the account you selected when you created 
your account.</p>

<p>Not all status reports will look the same. For instance, External Unix has a few extra lines that go in the 
project lines. These won't show up for any other group.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the screen of information will be two links. Email the status report which will send the 
information listed in your status report for the selected week off to the e-mail address you used when you 
registered an account on the system. And Edit the Status Report which puts you into the Edit the Status Report 
screen.</p>

<title>Status Management Portal</title>

<body>

<p>If you haven't logged in yet, you will be presented with a login page. If you're creating a new account, you'll 
need to follow the steps to create the account and then let me know so I can assign you to your team. Once that's done, 
the next visit to the Portal page will present the correct information.</p>

<center><img src="portal.jpg"></center>

<p>The first box on the Portal page is a button to provide access to the Status Management Menu. You're free to 
read the information provided below it before entering or just go on in and begin entering data.</p>

<p>At the upper right corner of every page is a <b>Home / Logout (your name)</b> pair of links. Home returns 
you to the Status Management Menu and of course, Logout logs you out of the system.</p>

<h4>News</h4>

<p>I'll place items of importance to the site here such as the site is moving or if I'm taking it down for 
maintenance.</p>

<h4>Corrections and Enhancements</h4>

<p>As I make changes to the application, I update the application change management system and changes are shown 
here. There may be several entries and a "View older entries..." link at the bottom of the block. As you work in 
the system, all entries older than this week will be hidden behind that link. If you want to see older work, click 
the link.</p>

<h4>Todo</h4>

<p>These are bigger things that I want to eventually correct. Feel free to send me an e-mail if you find something 
not working as expected or if you have an enhancement you think would be helpful to the team.</p>

<h4>Finally</h4>

<p>I put a block at the end to provide a little history behind why I did this application.</p>
